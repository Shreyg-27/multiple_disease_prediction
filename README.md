# multiple_disease_prediction

This project is a machine learning-based system for predicting three different diseases - diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. 
The system is built using the Streamlit framework and utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a person having one of these 
diseases based on their input data.

### Usage

To use the prediction system, simply follow these steps:

1) Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

2) Run the application using the command streamlit run predictionsystem.py.

3) Once the application is running, select the disease you want to predict- heart, parkinsons, and diabetes.

4) Enter the required input data, such as age, gender, blood pressure, and other relevant factors.

5) Click on the button.

### Conclusion

This machine learning-based disease prediction system is a useful tool for predicting the likelihood of a person having diabetes, 
heart disease, or Parkinson's disease based on their input data. The system is easy to use and provides accurate predictions based on machine learning algorithms.
